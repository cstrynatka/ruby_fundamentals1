This repo contains all the assignments given to us in class for the first week-to-two-weeks in the coding bootcamp. It also contains other exercises I completed on my own time to further cement my understanding of Ruby.

Some of the more difficult ones at this point were FizzBuzz, creating a valid and working CRM, and converting between units of measurement (i.e. pounds to kilos, Fahrenheit to Celsius). Although each one took me hours, I read as much as I could and tried to do everything on my own without copying and coding.
